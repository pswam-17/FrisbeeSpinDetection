**Navigation:**

In the main folder, there are two folders. Arduino contains the code for the project, and Documentation has a README for all of the steps taken during design and testing phases.

You will also see the project report on the home page, which will go into the making of the project with greater detail (NOTE: links have a space in them due to formatting; remove space to see files).
